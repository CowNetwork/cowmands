# Cowmands

We all know it and hate it: The Spigot/Bukkit command system with its `CommandExecutor` and `TabCompletor`. It's all fun and games, but with subcommands it just is tedious work.
For that purpose we have this small library, which allows to declare your commands and subcommands in a simple way and let it handle the Bukkit stuff for you.
